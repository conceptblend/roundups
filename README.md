Examples of Round Ups in the wild

This is a small collection of how I've seen Round Ups work in different applications. Round Ups are a way of "saving your change" when you make purchases. How ever they're calculated, the virtual "change" is moved to some savings account to accumulate. Some models pay out immediately, others need to be "cashed out". Either way, your change is adding up.

PS This was a bit of a lazy prototype to demonstrate the differences. I'm not particularly worried about the abhorrent code ;)
